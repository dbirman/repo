Outline

Intro/problem setup
 - phil doesn't give good solutions
 - we run into a wall the hrd prob
 - how do we get around the wall?
 - ecological relevance? function/fitness?
 - neurons?
History
 - undergrad interest 1 para
 - work w/ john, interest in connecting neural measures -> behavior
Grad work w/ Justin
 - how do we isolate the right neural activity
Impact
 - we need a model of mind
 - we can't solve hrd prob w/ phil, need neural

 Proposal

 One unsolved prob
  - how does attention link to perception
  - sensory enhancement vs. gating function
 Project
  - test this by looking at what neural change we need to model to predict behavior
  - prediction of model -> tms MT has no effect, test this
 Impact
  - we have to solve the hrd prob, neuro gives us a possible window, but we have to understand the loa of networks
